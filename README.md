# Machine.Specifications.Core
.NET Core version of [Machine.Specifications](https://github.com/machine)

This is not a fork. The reasoning behind this is to not have all the legacy from Machine.Specifications with support for .NET CLR 2.0. Potentially this could go back into the Machine.Specifications repository. But for now its just sitting outside to avoid having to maintain #ifdef all over the place for the changed bits of .NET Core.

The code has been copied and adapted from the original repository. 

# How does it work?
